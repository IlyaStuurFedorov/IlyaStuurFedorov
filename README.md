### Hi there, I am Ilya Fedorov, also known as "Stuur".ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Unary.Common. It is a big project, that allows C++ programmers to have a JIT architecture for their apps.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Unary.Common was originally made with C# for Godot engine, but due to limitations from language & engine & scripting implementation that idea had to be dropped.
