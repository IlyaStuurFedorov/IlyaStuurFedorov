# Hi there, I am Ilya Fedorov, also known as "Stuur".ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on game called [Recusant](https://github.com/unaryinc/RecusantGame), [custom Godot engine clone](https://github.com/unaryinc/RecusantGodot) and a [launcher](https://github.com/unaryinc/RecusantLauncher) for all of it. It is a big project, that allows us to treat modders as in-house developers with full access to on-demand compilation pipeline, original C++ codebase and native developement tools that were used by us for the game.
