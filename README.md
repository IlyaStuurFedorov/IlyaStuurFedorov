# Hi there, I am Ilya Fedorov, also known as "Stuur".ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on game called [Recusant](https://github.com/unaryinc/Recusant) with [launcher](https://github.com/unaryinc/Launcher) for it. It is a big project, that allows us to treat modders as in-house developers with full access to on-demand compilation pipeline, original C++ codebase and native developement tools that were used by us.
