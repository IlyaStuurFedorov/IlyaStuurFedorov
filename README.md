### Hi there, I am Ilya Fedorov, also known as "Stuur".ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on [Unary.Common](https://github.com/unaryinc/Unary.Common). It is a big project, that allows C++ programmers to have a JIT architecture for their apps.
- âš¡ Fun fact: [Unary.Common](https://github.com/unaryinc/Unary.Common) was originally made [with C# and Godot engine in mind](https://github.com/unaryinc/Unary.Common-Godot), but due to my dissatisfaction with C#, Godot and scripting implementation that idea had to be dropped.
